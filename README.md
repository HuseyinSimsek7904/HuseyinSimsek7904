Hi, I am Hüseyin Şimşek.
I live in İstanbul, Turkey. I am studying computer engineering at Istanbul Technical University and this is my first year.

I am interested in coding, especially in Python and C#. Python is the first programming language I learned and it has been 4 years since I first started learning it. I would like to learn more about C++.
